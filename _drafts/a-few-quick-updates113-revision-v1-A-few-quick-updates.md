Five years, five updates. Sounds about right.

A few quick updates, in the interest in posting more than once a year:

  * I&#8217;ve been managing other writers for almost four years now, so I should probably change my byline to reflect that. I&#8217;m still writing and working on tool/architecture stuff. But at some point, I should write down some snappy articles with management tips and tricks. Maybe some stuff on synergy and paradigm shifts.
  * My byline also mentioned being a FrameMaker nerd. I&#8217;ve barely used FrameMaker in the last five years, except to get stuff out of it. Aside from a few things still lingering in `*.fm` files, most of my company uses DITA, and some of use Markdown and Jekyll. But the eventual plan is to move everything to MadCap Flare. So maybe I&#8217;ll write about that more later. For now, strike FrameMaker from the byline.
  * I&#8217;ve been doing some programming lately, mostly in the quest to get a bunch of DITA converted over to Flare. Whenever I&#8217;ve run into a conversion or production program that required custom code, I&#8217;ve always said &#8220;I&#8217;m not a programmer&#8221; and then spent months trying to get developer time to fix it. I think it&#8217;s time I change that to &#8220;I&#8217;m not a very good programmer&#8221; and work on improving that. As of late, that&#8217;s involved a lot of Python, so you may see some posts on that.

Of course, I&#8217;m saying all of this, and I may not post again until 2024 because I&#8217;m so busy. But, stay tuned.
