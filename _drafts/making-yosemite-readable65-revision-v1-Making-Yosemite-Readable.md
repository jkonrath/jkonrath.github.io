I resisted the upgrade to Yosemite, even though I have a pretty new mid-2014 MacBook Pro, because I&#8217;d rather let someone else beta-test things before I upgrade. When I finally did upgrade, I noticed a problem: my eyes were _killing_ me.  Granted, I&#8217;ve put a few hundred thousand miles on my eyeballs over the last few decades, but this was a sudden and marked problem.

I think there are a few things going on here, but the big two are the layout and the font. There&#8217;s a lot more brightness and transparency in the general look and feel of the layout. And Yosemite switched system fonts, from Lucida Grande to Helvetica Neue. They&#8217;re both sans serif fonts, but for whatever reason, the Helvetica taxes my eyes way too much.

I was reluctant to do anything. I hate customizing my system, because then when I change computers, I have to re-remember everything I configured, and I don&#8217;t want to be one of those people that has a freaky version of Windows 8 that&#8217;s customized to look like Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with a yellow on pink interface and the fonts in Papyrus, and if I can&#8217;t get that, I can&#8217;t work.

But, anyway, here are a few fixes I messed with:

  1. Select** System Preferences > Accessibility > Reduce Transparency** (This is true by default if #3 below is also true. This can also allegedly speed up UI lag.)
  2. Set **System Preferences > General > Appearance** to **Graphite**
  3. Select **System Preferences > Accessibility > Increase contrast.**
  4. I don&#8217;t do this, selecting **System Preferences > General > Use dark menu bar and dock** might be to your preference
  5. Change the system font back using this: <https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeyosemite>
