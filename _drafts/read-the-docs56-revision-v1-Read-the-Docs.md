Here&#8217;s something neat I found recently, while looking for some api docs. It&#8217;s been around for a while, but you might not have seen it if you don&#8217;t work with Python much.

Check this out: <a href="https://readthedocs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://readthedocs.org</a>

It&#8217;s a documentation repository, and you can find docs for a lot of Python projects there, in one searchable place. And you can host docs for your own project there, too.

But what&#8217;s neat about it is you can author your docs in reStructuredText or Markdown, and have them built for online reading, or as an ePub or PDF for download. You can import docs from source control systems like git or subversion, and use hooks to automatically rebuild every time you push code.

This is a pretty cool project with a lot of other features, and totally free, although you may want to <a href="https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help them out</a> with a few bucks, too.
