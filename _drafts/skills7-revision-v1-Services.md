Some of the services I provide are:

  * Information architecture, including planning and design of  
    documentation sets.
  * Planning and design of documentation systems, such as knowledge  
    bases, wikis, and content management systems.</p> 
      * FrameMaker book design, templates, automation, and documentation  
        workflow development.
      * Design and authoring of end-user and internal conceptual and  
        procedural guides, such as user  
        guides, install guides, and quick start manuals.
      * API documentation, including guides, tutorials, HTML-based docs such as  
        JavaDoc or Eclipse Help, and examples.
      * Documentation migration, especially transfer of legacy  
        documentation to FrameMaker or CMS systems.
      * Design, implementation, and authoring of online help systems,  
        specializing in one-off custom systems, but RoboHelp is excellent, too. </ul></p>
