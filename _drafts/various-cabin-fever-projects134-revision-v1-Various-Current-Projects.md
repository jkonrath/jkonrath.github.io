Due to cabin fever (or whatever you call it), I&#8217;ve been working on a lot of oddball programming projects. I mean, I&#8217;m working way too much at the day job, because I can&#8217;t really leave the house, so I&#8217;m always on. But I&#8217;ve also been doing various things (and then not finishing them) mostly because I don&#8217;t have a basement where I can start building a boat out of matchsticks or something.

Anyway, here&#8217;s a partial list of what&#8217;s on the various back burners of my stove. If you&#8217;re really insanely curious about any of these, let me know and maybe I&#8217;ll actually finish them.

  * I&#8217;ve been messing around more on GitHub. I&#8217;ve been doing this at my job too, but I&#8217;m trying to make an effort to be more active on my personal profile. If you have the time and you use any open source software, I&#8217;d encourage you to do the same. Even if you&#8217;re not a programmer, it&#8217;s good to know how to complain about their documentation and maybe fix a few things if you find them. My personal profile is here: <a href="https://github.com/jkonrath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/jkonrath</a>
  * GitHub has caused me to dig up all of the various college coding projects and see if they&#8217;re worthwhile to post on here, just for kicks. They are all fairly horrible, so no. I&#8217;m almost tempted to post the first coding project I actually got paid to do, which I still have. It was for the USGS and it did something with well depth analysis, which I totally don&#8217;t understand. The code itself is an exercise on how to not to do what we&#8217;d call Big Data analysis now, and would probably be about ten lines of Python. Fun nostalgia though.
  * Just for kicks, I started writing a Markdown to HTML program, but decided to do it all in straight-up C, using C89 ANSI C and the standard library, nothing more. Outside of Arduino C, I haven&#8217;t done much C program in&#8230; a long time. I realized why when I started working with strings. I have a newfound appreciation for Python&#8217;s built-in string support.
  * I also realized, digging through the archives, that I know more XSLT than I realized. I posted a gist about this on GitHub, but I probably should make a whole project that&#8217;s a collection of all the dumb little building blocks I used constantly when I did this on a daily basis. (Like I always have to look up how to split one file into many files. I need to write that down somewhere.)
  * I found this giant XSLT I used at a previous job to chop up Doxygen&#8217;s XML output and convert it into something I could pull into a structured FrameMaker doc. Looking at it, I&#8217;m not sure how useful it is, because I was doing a bunch of arbitrary reordering of the doc because&#8230; well, let&#8217;s say just because.
  * I also started working on an XSLT to convert WordPress output to a Flare document. I really do love that Flare documents are just XML, and you can do anything with them.
  * I converted this blog to <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a>, but in the process I realized it&#8217;s faster for me on a site this small to keep it in WordPress, so I didn&#8217;t use the conversion. It was a fun learning process, though.
  * I&#8217;ve been messing with <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArchiveBox</a>, which is a neat idea. It&#8217;s a system where you feed in URLs and it archives them in various formats. It&#8217;s sort of a DIY Internet Archive. I&#8217;ve been learning more Docker by running it with Docker-compose, and complaining on their GitHub page about various minor problems. I should spend some time helping them rewrite their docs.
  * Another site where I should pay more attention is Stack Overflow. I&#8217;m on there at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/99038/jon-konrath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/users/99038/jon-konrath</a>. Funny to look back at all the FrameMaker and Doxygen posts I was answering way back when.

Speaking of obsessively building stuff in your basement, this is one of my favorite videos ever: <a href="https://vimeo.com/166403522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://vimeo.com/166403522</a>
