It seems like the days of cardboard key templates are over &#8211; they were a huge thing back in the old days when I started as a consultant in the computer labs back in college. Most of the cool kids would memorize everything, but more of the &#8220;returning&#8221; students would overlay the laminated cut-outs over the function keys for WordPerfect or Lotus 1-2-3.

Anyway, I&#8217;m only an occasional Photoshop user &#8211; touching up screenshots, and making dumb collages of friends&#8217; heads I post on Facebook. So I never remember anything. Here&#8217;s a great download for Mac users of Photoshop CC. (There&#8217;s also a Windows version mentioned.)
