Just a quick note that I'm currently hiring three tech writers at Postman:

Check out the job on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2737540462/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2737540462/)

I'm looking for people who understand docs-as-code and are comfortable writing
Markdown and using GitHub, owning their own parts of the product, working independently
with squads, and who are excited about the future of the Postman API platform.

These are fully-remote positions, but are US-only. Drop a line if you have any questions!
