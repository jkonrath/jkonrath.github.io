Looks like it's time for my annual update. I'm actually typing this from 40,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean, on my way to Maui, where I will attempt to not think about technical writing, management, or work for the next seven days. But thanks to Git, I can work on this while I'm no the plane. (That always seems to be the example they give in Git training, right? "So it's all in your local repo. If you get on a plane and aren't on the internet, you can still work." Right?)

The big update: I completed an MBA recently. This was at Western Governors University, which has a fully-remote, proficiency-based program. It's a neat model for learning; basically you enroll by the term, but then you finish classes as slow or as fast as you want. So instead of like enrolling in twelve credit hours for a semester, you do as many classes as you want to finish in six months.

I still worked full-time (or more than full time, really), but I type fast. So I was able to finish the two-year program in about five months. I started on June 1, and my graduation date was officially October 24, although I finished my last class about a week before that.

This program was an IT Management version of the MBA, so it contained a few courses specific to IT project management. But otherwise, it had all the same classes as a regular business MBA. (I think I skipped an operations management class, and a public speaking think, which, awesome. When I was an undergrad and had to take a speech class, I did it at 8am in a summer session, so it was only six people.)

I think the first question people ask me is, "Why?" I know I don't know any other tech writers with an MBA, and I have never applied for a job that required one. But I had a few thoughts about why I wanted to do this:

* I am a manager, and I never had any formal training as a manager. I have spent some time on Udemy watching leadership videos, and I have a whole shelf of half-read management books. But I felt like I needed something that said I was a manager, or at least something more than the few Agile crash course certification badges on my LinkedIn.
* I've always vaguely wanted a graduate degree, although never knew how that would happen.
* I don't intend to move on to being a CTO or a PM or anything else. But I could see a future someday at some other company where another department got shoved next to the tech writing department (UX? research? QA?) and I would need to manage both. And I'd like to be prepared for that.
* I'm not starting up a company. But in working at a start-up, I'm constantly inundated with discussion about financing and organization and whatever, so maybe I need to know more about it.
* This was way outside my wheelhouse. It would be hard. And I need to do things outside my wheelhouse that are hard.
* It's arguably more interesting than doing crossword puzzles in my spare time.
